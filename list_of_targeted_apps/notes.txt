xiaomi: tested on redmi note 8 pro running MIUI 12.5
google_apps: based off Samsung Galaxy A52s and redmi note 8 pro preloaded | I have tried GmapsWV with chrome uninstalled, working fine

samsung:
- based off the Galaxy A52s on Android 14 and itentionally installing some samsung apps
- also a keyboard with direct boot is a MUST BEFORE uninstalling the stock keyboard app ABOVE ALL ELSE (AnySoftKeyboard is the only FOSS Keyboard and FUTO does not support Direct Boot)
- Confirmed uninstalling the OneUI Launcher does in fact break recents app, Uninstalling it will not be accepted (PR or Otherwise)
