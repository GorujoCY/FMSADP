# In concerns of offline release
Codeberg limits file size to 100MB even on releases therefore those coming through codeberg you can either:
1. Install from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/GorujoCY/FMSADP/releases/latest)
2. Install through [Proton Drive](https://drive.proton.me/urls/333Y0RFB4W#SFEO3wys0Uiv) if you for some reason refuse to use github, either option is valid

keep in mind that if you run from source, it requests github for the bundled apks zip. Unless I used tresorit send or pcloud transfer (the fact that both require email to even get me a link, forget it), this isn't possible and there aren't any good options to store at least a gigabyte or 1.1GB file permanently, means I resorted to github releases as the next best option.
### More readme stuff coming soon
