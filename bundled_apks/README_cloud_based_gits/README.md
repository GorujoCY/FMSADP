Due to the 100MB limit on codeberg (And 25MB on github). Users running the offline version of the software from source may head to the proton drive link down below to download the bundled apks for the software to work, please put the files in exactly the `bundled_apks` folder and nowhere else (unless you wanna modify the modules to point at the correct directory after_. Please read the README.txt located in README/README.txt for info on then bundled apks itself:
